Artifacts from the online course, ChatGPT Prompt Enginnering for Developers by OpenAI

The course can be found here: https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/

When I went through the course, rather than executing the course examples in the Jupyter Notebook instance provided in the course, I executed the examples in Jupyter Notebook running on my own PC. 

To get the course examples to run on my PC, I had update the version of Anaconda that was on my machine to the latest version (3.10), install 3 additional Python libraries, and set ip an OPENAI key environment variable. 

Upon completing the course I created a presentation to provide the knowledge a non-developer would need to take and understand the course. 

This repository contains 2 types of files:
1. The Jupyter Notebooks I created while taking the course. These notebooks are very similar to the Notebooks used in the course, but have a few small from my experiments.
2. A presentation and supporting files for the presentation.

Jupyter Notebook Files: Each file corresponds to a chapter from the course
- 1 Guidelines for Prompting.ipynb
- 2 Iterative Prompt Development.ipynb
- 3 Summarizing.ipynb
- 4 Inferring.ipynb
- 5 Transforming.ipynb
- 6 Expanding.ipynb
- 7 Chatbot.ipynb
