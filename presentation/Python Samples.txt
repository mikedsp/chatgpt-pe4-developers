This file contains a few simple Python code samples to use when building MyNewNotebook
to test that you're PC is setup for the course

Cell 1
-------
from platform import python_version
print (python_version())


Cell 2 (requires the openai key to have been set up on your PC)
--------
import openai
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file

openai.api_key  = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')



Cell 3
---------------
def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]

Cell 4
---------------------
text = f"""
Got this for my daughter for her birthday cuz she keeps taking \
mine from my room.  
"""
prompt = f"proofread and correct this review: ```{text}```"
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
